# Intruduction

## Types of graph
 
 * **Two types of graph:**
     * Undirected graph
     * Directed graph

## Degree, Indegree and Outdegree
 * **Degree, Indegree and Outdegree**
      * In Undirected graph
        * No of nodes connected with the vertex is called degree in case of undirected graph.
        
      * In Directed graph
        * No of incoming nodes in undirected graph is called indegree.
        * No of Outgoing nodes in undirected graph is called outdegree.
        
* **Total degree of all the nodes in an undirected graph will be equal to the 2 multiplied by total no. of edges, i.e(2xE)**

## Path
* **Path in a graph**
     * **In an undirected graph**: Path is the sequence of nodes or vertex such that none of the nodes are repeating or visited twice in the path
     * **In directed graph**: If there is an edge between 1 to 5 then you can go from 1 to 5 but you can't go from 5 to 1.

## Cyclic and Acylic

* **Undirected cyclic graph**: If there is a cycle in an undirected graph then it is called undirected cyclic graph.

* **Undirected Acylic graph**: If there is no cycle in an undirected graph then it is called undirected acylic graph.

* **Directed cyclic graph**: If there is a cycle in a directed graph then that is called directed cyclic graph.

* **Directed Acylic graph**: If there is no cycle in a directed graph then it is called directed acylic graph, this is commonly known as DAG(will be used many times).

### Now the last kind of graph is the weighted graph, all of the above types will be there in the weighted graph also

# Weighted graph

  * Undirected weighted graph
      * Undirected weighted cyclic graph
      * Undirected weighted acylic graph
  * Directed weighted graph
      * Directed weighted cyclic graph
      * Directed weighted acylic graph

### Important point: If the weights are not given i.e if the graph is unweighted and you are solving a problem where weight is necessary and you need the weight to perform certain operations, consider the weight of each edge to be the unit weight i.e 1.

# Graph representation

## Matrix Representation

![Screenshot from 2021-08-27 17-07-55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42698268/131122243-0f14ba40-91c6-4784-b346-c5be36656c75.png)

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int n, m;
    cin>>n>>m;
    
    //declare the adjacency matrix for graph
    //as graph has one based indexing so you have to take the matrix of size 1 greater
    //if 0 based indexing, matrix size = mat[m][n]
    //if 1 based indexing, matrix size = mat[m+1][n+1]
    int mat[n+1][m+1];
    
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
        int u, v;
        cin>>u>>v;
        mat[u][v] = 1;
        mat[v][u] = 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
But, if the range of n is larger, then we can't create matrix, e.g, if n is 10^5 then we'd need the space of 10^10 to store the matrix, in that case we'd use, **Adjacency List**

## Adjacency List representation
It would be a list of vectors, i.e there would be vector for each node and that will store the adjacent nodes list, i.e basically there would be n size array and at each element there would be vector which would store all the adjacent nodes, there would be 2XE adjacent elements in total (in case of undirected graph) where E is total no. of edges, because if there is an edge between 1 and 2 then there is an edge between 2 and 1 also.

vector<int> adj[n]
when we'll want to push an element into the adjacency list, we'd say adj[u].push_back(v) and adj[v].push_back(u), this is for undirected graph, but for directed graph only write adj[u].push_back(v)



In case if the graph is weighted then you have to declare it as vector<pair<int, int>> adj[n], so that you can store the weight, first will store the adjacent node and second will store the weight, and how you'll push it: adj[u].push_back({v, w}) where w represents weight, we'll see while solving questions.

Unweighted graph
 
 ```cpp
 #include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    // n = no. of vertices
    //m = no. of edges
    int n, m;
    cin>>n>>m;
    
    //size will be n+1 as graph is 1 based indexing in our case.
    vector<int> adj[n+1];
    
    
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
        int u, v;
        cin>>u>>v;
        
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        //if the graph is undirected then ommit the next line
        adj[v].push_back(u);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
 ```
 
 Weighted Graph
 
 ```cpp
 #include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    // n = no. of vertices
    //m = no. of edges
    int n, m;
    cin>>n>>m;
    
    //size will be n+1 as graph is 1 based indexing in our case.
    //as graph is weighted so take pair
    vector<pair<int, int>> adj[n+1];
    
    for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
        int u, v, wt;
        cin>>u>>v>>wt;
        
        adj[u].push_back({v, wt});
        adj[v].push_back({u, wt});
    }
    
    return 0;
}
 ```
