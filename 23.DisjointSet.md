# Disjoint set data structure or Union-Find
* This is used to find out, if two nodes are given then whether they belong to same component or not
* It consists of two methods, find and union. find will help to find the parent of the node, and union will help you to combine two components i.e union(u, v) will combine the component in which u is and the component in which v is.
* Disjoint set data structure is used in Kruskal's algorithm in detecting a cycle and at lot of places in CP.
